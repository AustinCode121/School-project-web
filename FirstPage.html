         <h2>Chosing high school classes</h2>
        <h4>In 8th grade, I want to plan. Plan for high school classes especially high school college classes. I think being prepared for high school is very important, not even high school life in general. Being prepared for anything in life helps you a lot. Being prepared is a really important thing for me, and I hope I can accomplish that next year. Something that I might face along the way is not having time, to do things. If I wanna do something like soccer but I have many classes, I planned it might not be the best, I think there might be ways I could fix that problem. </h4>
