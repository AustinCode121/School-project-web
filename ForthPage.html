        <h2>Get a house</h2>
           <h2>Having a Home is something that every adult wants, you have your own space. I think that this will be something nice for me to have, and I don't have to live with my parents. Owning a house is expensive though, and I would have to talk about loans. That is something every adult faces having to get loans and paying off their mortgage. Though I would have to spend lots of money for a home, it would be something totally worth it. I wanna move since staying put isnt the most fun thing.
