        <h2>find a good college</h2>
        <h4>Before I start college, I wanna make sure the college I go to is a good college for my profession. The college I am thinking of going to is. Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a nice college with a  7 percent acceptance rate. I think it is a challenge I am willing to go forward with. Additionally the area around it is a really nice place. It has what I want, and lots of family lives there which would be fun. College will be the milestone that leads me to my future that I want and making sure it is exactly what I want makes life even easier.</h4>
