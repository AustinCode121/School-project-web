        <h2> Start to save money for the future.</h2>
        <h2>Freshman Year I wanna start a business, a small website selling business, it would help me. If I can start an income it would be very easy for me to save money monthly. And I could buy things I want more often, It would be hard. Knowing that it is getting easier and easier for people with business to make their own websites. Companies like Wix make it harder for web developers to sell their websites. Thought the problem of giant corporations taking small businesses down is a problem. If the market good and be easy to contact I think that it would be a nice and easy income for a high school student.
